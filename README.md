## Getting Started

This project is a simple todo app that allows users to manage their tasks. It utilizes local storage with the sqflite package to store and retrieve todo items. Additionally, it implements a concept of switchable theme modes, allowing users to switch between dark and light themes.

Features
The todo app provides the following features:

- Add a todo item: Users can add new tasks to the todo list. Each todo item consists of a title, description, and type .

- Update a todo item: Users can modify the details of an existing todo item. They can change the title, description, type, or mark the task as completed.

- Delete a todo item: Users can remove a todo item from the list.

- List todo items: The app displays a list of all todo items, showing their titles and description. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from active ones.

- Switch theme mode: Users can switch between dark and light themes to customize the app's appearance based on their preference.
